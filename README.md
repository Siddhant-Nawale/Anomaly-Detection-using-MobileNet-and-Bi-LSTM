# Anomaly-Detection-using-MobileNet-and-Bi-LSTM

## Description

Video surveillance systems are integral for maintaining security and safety across various environments. The primary purpose of these systems is to monitor live footage and identify any unusual activities or behaviors that may pose a threat. Traditional approaches relied heavily on manual monitoring, leading to increased false negative rates in anomaly detection. To address this, a novel framework leveraging MobileNet and Bi-LSTM with unsupervised learning techniques has been proposed.

## Getting Started

```bash
Download the dataset
Run Augmentation.py file to Augment your dataset
Run Training.py file to train your model
Run Pred_Manual.py file to test your trained model on different images manually
Run Pred_WebCam.py file to test your trained model on different images using WebCam
```
